# AgentDock

AgentDock is an unofficial, cloud-oriented coding-agent runtime built around
the Pi RPC runtime. The goal is not to wrap Pi in a web page, but to build the control
plane and execution infrastructure required to run coding agents safely and
reliably for multiple users.

## Project positioning

The finished system should demonstrate:

- ordered, durable agent sessions;
- real-time agent and tool event streaming;
- isolated workspaces and sandboxed tool execution;
- cancellation, approval, retry, eviction, and recovery;
- tenant quotas, scheduling, leases, and backpressure;
- subagent trees with independent context and resource budgets;
- Git worktree isolation for concurrent writing agents;
- observability, load testing, and failure-injection evidence.

This repository is intentionally documentation-first. Business code should be
added one verified vertical slice at a time.

## Planned architecture

```text
Browser / CLI
    |
    | REST + SSE
    v
TypeScript Control Plane (NestJS)
    |-- session mailbox and turn scheduler
    |-- sandbox leases and fencing tokens
    |-- approvals, quotas, usage, event index
    |-- PostgreSQL + MinIO/S3
    |
    | versioned command/event protocol
    v
TypeScript Sandbox Supervisor
    |-- pinned Pi RPC child process
    |-- event spool and session snapshots
    |-- extension Web-UI bridge
    |-- sandbox lifecycle and heartbeats
    v
Docker / Kubernetes Sandbox
    |-- isolated workspace
    |-- shell, compiler, tests, Git worktrees
    `-- CPU, memory, PID, disk, time, and network limits
```

## Initial technology choices

- Control plane: TypeScript, Node.js, NestJS with the Fastify adapter
- Runner: TypeScript supervisor plus a pinned `pi --mode rpc` child process
- Internal protocol: versioned TypeBox schemas over an outbound WebSocket
- Browser event delivery: SSE with resumable sequence numbers
- Metadata and durable commands: PostgreSQL with Kysely
- Session/workspace artifacts: MinIO locally, S3-compatible storage later
- Sandbox: Docker first, Kubernetes later
- Frontend: React, kept deliberately small
- Observability: OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo
- Tests: Vitest, Testcontainers, k6, Toxiproxy

Kafka, Flink, Redis, Temporal, billing, RAG, mobile applications, and IDE
plugins are not part of the initial implementation. They should be introduced
only after a measured requirement appears.

## Core invariants

1. A session has at most one normal active turn at a time.
2. A command is durably stored before the API reports it as accepted.
3. Reusing an idempotency key never creates a second turn.
4. Only the runner holding the current fencing token may mutate a session.
5. Every session event has a monotonically increasing sequence number.
6. Cold sessions consume no dedicated process, OS thread, or sandbox.
7. A tool with external side effects is never blindly described as exactly-once.
8. Two writer agents never modify the same worktree concurrently.
9. Tenant workspaces, session state, artifacts, and secrets are isolated.
10. Every milestone has executable acceptance tests and failure tests.

## Current executable spike

The first compatibility boundary lives in
[`spikes/pi-extension-compat`](spikes/pi-extension-compat). It starts a real,
pinned Pi RPC process, loads an extension, bridges a confirm/notify exchange,
maps that exchange through the public event contract, and verifies clean
shutdown without spending model tokens. The reusable TypeBox contract and Pi
adapter live in [`packages/protocol`](packages/protocol) and
[`packages/sandbox-supervisor`](packages/sandbox-supervisor).

## Current status

Phase 0: the versioned public event envelope and Pi UI adapter are implemented,
and the local Pi RPC extension compatibility spike passes end to end. The
hardened non-root Docker run remains to be verified once Docker is available
in WSL. The next slice is the supervisor/control-plane wire protocol, because
events need registration, commands, ACKs, replay, and heartbeat semantics
before they can safely cross a network boundary.
